# UnicodeHelper
[![Test status](https://github.com/FoolRunning/UnicodeHelper/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FoolRunning/UnicodeHelper/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

*Note: This is a work-in-progress. In particular, some methods on UString have not been implemented yet.* 

UnicodeHelper is a .Net library to get Unicode property information about codepoints, and to better handle the 
upper planes (1-16) of Unicode where having to deal with surrogate pairs can get messy using normal .Net strings. 
Current version supoorts **Unicode 16.0.0**.

A goal for this library is to have *every* implemented method be extensively tested, so it should already be fairly stable.

Available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnicodeHelper).

## Main API
### UCodepoint
Represents an entire Unicode codepoint (32-bit value).

Also provides access to Unicode properties of individual codepoints via static methods. It can be implicitly casted from a .Net character, so most methods will accept a normal .Net ``char`` as well as a ``UCodepoint`` without any explicit casting:
```c#
char c = 'a';
UnicodeCategory cat = UCodepoint.GetUnicodeCategory(c); // No casting needed here
```

### UString (WIP)
Represents a sequence of Unicode codepoints.

The idea is to be able to replace a .Net ``string`` with a ``UString`` in as many cases as possible and as efficiently as possible.

### UnicodeProperties
Used to get advanced properties of a Unicode codepoint.

Represents the data in the Unicode specification [PropList.txt](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#PropList.txt) and [DerivedCoreProperties.txt](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#DerivedCoreProperties.txt).

### UnicodeNames
Used to get the defined names of a Unicode codepoint.

Represents the data in the Unicode specification [DerivedName.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/extracted/DerivedName.txt) and [NameAliases.txt](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#NameAliases.txt).

### UnicodeBlocks
Used to get the block for which a Unicode codepoint belongs.

Represents the data in the Unicode specification [Blocks.txt](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Blocks.txt).

## Examples
* Using a UCodepoint
```c#
UCodepoint uc = '6';
Console.WriteLine(UCodepoint.GetUnicodeCategory(uc));
/* Result:
DecimalDigitNumber
*/
```
```c#
Console.WriteLine(UCodepoint.IsUpper('T'));
/* Result:
True
*/
```

* Extension method for .Net strings to get the Unicode codepoints without having to create a UString instance.
```c#
string dotNetString = "Hi 游때!";
foreach (UCodepoint uc in dotNetString.Codepoints())
	Console.WriteLine(uc);
/* Result:
H
i

游때
!
*/
```

* Using a UString is mostly just like using a .Net string.
```c#
UString us1 = new UString("Hello World!");
UString us2 = new UString("Welcome");
Console.WriteLine(us2 + us1.SubString(5, 6));
/* Result:
Welcome World
*/
```

* Using a UString with Unicode data from the upper planes is much easier than using a .Net string.
```c#
UString us = new UString("Hi 游때游뱂游땵");
Console.WriteLine(us.SubString(3, 3));
// A normal .Net string would be SubString(3, 6). You'd have to know they were represented by two chars each.
/* Result:
游때游뱂游땵
*/
```
